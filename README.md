This project uses Vite + ReactJS. 

- The application is a simple CRUD application, and is currently being used as a simple project for Research and Development.
- This application has also its own backend using NestJS w/ MongoDB, you can check it out through this link https://github.com/jajajaniiiine/book-club-app-api_nestjs.
- The backend of this project may come into different types in the future, meaning not just connected to NestJs. That will depend on what I will be researching in the future.
